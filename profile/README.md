# Hackathon Semarang - Pharos Builder Base Camp

## Project Description
This project is part of the Pharos Builder Base Camp hackathon, focusing on bridging TradFi (Traditional Finance) and DeFi (Decentralized Finance). The proposed idea is to create a business tokenization platform as a crowdfunding solution for business capital. Through this platform, businesses can issue tokens to raise funds, and token holders (investors) will receive profit-sharing based on their ownership percentage.

## Key Features
- **Asset Tokenization:** Issue tokens as a representation of ownership or a claim on business profits.
- **Crowdfunding Capital:** Raise funds from investors through token sales.
- **Profit Sharing System:** Automatically distribute profits to investors according to their token ownership.
- **Bridging TradFi and DeFi:** Combine traditional financial elements with blockchain technology by leveraging Pharos infrastructure (L1-Base, L1-Core, L1-Extension) and high-speed execution.
- **Transparency & Security:** Utilize smart contracts to ensure trust, transparency, and automation in all transactions.

## Hackathon Project Criteria
1. **Theme Focus:**
   - The project must bridge TradFi and DeFi, such as through asset tokenization, decentralized payment systems, DEX, smart wallet, or other disruptive ideas.
2. **Utilizing Pharos Infrastructure:**
   - The project should leverage Pharosâ€™ core technologies, including its modular stack and high-speed execution, ensuring fast and scalable solutions.
3. **Viable Business Potential:**
   - The project must have a feasible business application with real-world financial impact.
4. **Alignment with Available Tracks:**
   - This project fits into the **RWA + Payment** track, focusing on asset tokenization and innovative payment systems.
5. **Presentation and Pitch:**
   - Clear documentation, interactive demos, and engaging presentations will be key factors during judging.

## Profit Sharing Mechanism
The platform will implement an automated profit-sharing mechanism via smart contracts. The proposed workflow includes:
- **Token Issuance:** Businesses issue tokens as proof of ownership over a share of profits.
- **Token Purchase:** Investors buy tokens to support business capital.
- **Profit Distribution:** Profits are periodically distributed to investors based on their token holdings.
- **Automation & Transparency:** Smart contracts ensure that the profit distribution process is automated, transparent, and timely, leveraging the Pharos infrastructure.

## References & Inspirations
Some platforms that serve as inspiration for this concept include:
- [Polkastarter](https://polkastarter.com/)
- [DaoMaker](https://app.daomaker.com/)

Both platforms have successfully implemented crowdfunding and tokenization models that connect investors with innovative blockchain projects.

## Project Architecture
- **Frontend:** A web interface for user interaction, registration, and investment monitoring.
- **Backend:** APIs integrated with smart contracts to manage transactions, verifications, and profit distributions.
- **Smart Contracts:** Code governing token issuance, sales, and profit-sharing mechanisms, running on the Pharos infrastructure.
